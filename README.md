# üåø Bhu-Shakti: AI-Powered Ag-Advisory System

Bhu-Shakti (Earth Power) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to democratize expert agricultural knowledge. It acts as a real-time, multimodal AI agronomist, market analyst, and farm manager, empowering farmers in remote and underserved regions to make data-driven decisions, increase yields, and promote sustainability.

AI-Powered PWA for Indian Farmers. Instant, multimodal crop disease diagnosis and predictive alerts (weather/pests). Uses Gemini/Genkit, Next.js, and Firestore for scalable, multi-language advisory.

# üéØ The Problem
Farmers often lack immediate access to expert advice, leading to:

Delayed Diagnosis: Waiting times for expert opinions result in significant crop loss due to pests and diseases.

Low Productivity: Reliance on traditional methods rather than data-driven decisions regarding irrigation, fertilizer use, and optimal sowing times.

Accessibility Gap: Existing digital tools often fail due to language barriers and limited internet connectivity in rural areas.

# ‚ú® The Bhu-Shakti Solution
Bhu-Shakti bridges this information gap by placing a comprehensive AI advisor directly into the farmer's hands.

# Key Features (High Impact)
Multimodal AI Diagnosis: Farmers upload a photo of a sick plant and describe symptoms to get instant identification and a step-by-step solution, significantly reducing crop loss.

Proactive & Predictive Alerts: Analyzes farm data and real-time weather (via Genkit Tools) to issue warnings for pest outbreaks or heat stress before they become critical, mitigating risk.

Conversational Assistant: Simple chat interface allows farmers to ask complex questions in their local language (e.g., "What's the 7-day forecast impact on my wheat crop?").

Multilingual & Audio Support: Full support for Hindi and Telugu, with built-in Audio Narration (Text-to-Speech) for all advisories, overcoming literacy barriers.

Farm Management Dashboard: Centralized PWA interface to manage crops, track growth, and view personalized insights and history, facilitating better record-keeping.

# üíª Technical Stack
Bhu-Shakti is built on a modern, serverless, and highly scalable architecture.

Frontend (PWA): Next.js (React App Router) for performance and interactivity, styled using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN/UI.

AI Backend & Orchestration: Genkit Framework orchestrating all AI-powered logic ("Flows").

Core AI Model: Google Gemini family of models, leveraged for multimodal (image/text) reasoning, language translation, and complex advisory generation.

Data Backbone: Cloud Firestore for real-time sync of user profiles, farm data, and diagnosis history.

External Data Integration: Genkit Tools are engineered to fetch real-time data and integrate with external APIs, including mockups for AgriStack and Soil Health Card (SHC) data.

# üöÄ Setup and Installation (PWA)
Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version)

A Google AI API Key with access to the Gemini family of models.

A Firebase project configured with Cloud Firestore.

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The application is designed as a PWA and can be installed directly from the browser on mobile devices for testing the native-like experience.

# ‚úÖ SIH Problem Statement Alignment (SIH25168)
Bhu-Shakti directly addresses the problem statement's call for a smart, data-driven advisory system by focusing on:

Personalized Advice: Generated by Gemini, customized to the farmer's crop, soil (via SHC integration), and real-time climate.

Accessibility: The PWA format, multilingual support, and audio narration meet the challenge of serving farmers with limited digital literacy.

Sustainability: The AI is instructed to prioritize and recommend water conservation techniques and organic pest control methods, fulfilling a key bonus requirement.
